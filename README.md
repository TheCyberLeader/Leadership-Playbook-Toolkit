# Leadership-Playbook-Toolkit 

## üéØ Purpose  
This repository is a culmination of my **MBA** and **MS in Leadership & Organizational Dynamics (Organizational Leadership concentration)** at the University of Michigan.  

Rather than a traditional dissertation, I built this as a **practical playbook** for professionals navigating leadership challenges in industry. It blends theory with application ‚Äî frameworks, tools, and reflections you can actually use in the workplace.

## üìÇ What‚Äôs Inside  

### **Change Management Framework**  

**Narrative**  
When I first studied change management, I thought it was about creating Gantt charts and project plans. My MBA reinforced that ‚Äî efficiency, timelines, ROI. But my MS experience shifted the lens: change succeeds or fails not because of the plan, but because of the people. This section collects the tools that helped me understand that balance.  

**Resources**  
- [UC Berkeley Change Management Toolkit (PDF)](https://hr.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/change_management_toolkit.pdf)  
- [Sparkbay: 10 Change Readiness Survey Questions](https://sparkbay.com/en/culture-blog/change-readiness-survey-questions-37)  
- [Prosci Change Management Case Studies](https://www.prosci.com/resources/success-stories?hsCtaAttrib=144189548436)  

**Reflection**  
Change readiness isn‚Äôt just about budgets or timelines; it‚Äôs about whether people believe in the journey. The frameworks here taught me that fundamental transformation happens when leaders create clarity, communicate consistently, and reinforce progress over time.

### **Negotiation & Conflict Resolution Tools**  

**Narrative**  
Early in my career, I thought negotiations were about outsmarting the other side. My coursework taught me something different: the real power lies in creating value and building relationships. Conflict doesn‚Äôt have to be destructive ‚Äî it can actually spark innovation if managed well.  

**Resources**  
- [Harvard Program on Negotiation ‚Äì Preparation Checklist](https://www.pon.harvard.edu/daily/negotiation-skills-daily/negotiation-preparation-checklist/)  
- [The PMO Squad Negotiation Template](https://www.thepmosquad.com/negotiation-template)  
- [IBER Global Negotiations Checklist (PDF)](https://www.iberglobal.com/files/ChecklistNegotiations1.pdf)  

**Reflection**  
Structured conflict, when managed with respect, surfaces better solutions. These templates remind me that preparation and empathy are the real differentiators in any negotiation. It‚Äôs not about ‚Äúwinning‚Äù ‚Äî it‚Äôs about creating outcomes people can live with and support.

### **Organizational Behavior Diagnostics**  

**Narrative**  
I‚Äôve always been fascinated by what makes teams ‚Äúclick.‚Äù In my MBA, I learned to read the numbers: engagement scores, productivity metrics, turnover rates. In my MS, I learned to listen for the story behind those numbers: trust, inclusion, culture. Diagnostics are the bridge between the two.  

**Resources**  
- [Gallup Q12 Employee Engagement Survey](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/349484/gallup-q12-employee-engagement-survey.aspx)  
- [Pace University ‚Äì Leadership Style Questionnaire (PDF)](https://www.pace.edu/sites/default/files/2021-06/leadership-style-questionnaire.pdf)
- [Eletive Blog: Employee Engagement Survey Question Guide](https://eletive.com/blog/employee-engagement-survey-questions/)  

**Reflection**  
Engagement diagnostics are not just numbers ‚Äî they‚Äôre signals of trust. My biggest takeaway is that metrics should drive dialogue, not just dashboards. Leaders need to act on what they learn, otherwise the survey itself becomes a symbol of distrust.

### **Leadership Theory Wiki**  

**Narrative**  
Textbooks love frameworks, and I‚Äôve studied a lot of them: Kotter, ADKAR, Tuckman, Situational Leadership. At first, I treated them like formulas ‚Äî just follow the steps. Over time, I realized they‚Äôre more like maps. They don‚Äôt tell you exactly how to get there, but they stop you from getting lost.  

**Resources**  
- [Kotter‚Äôs 8-Step Change Model (PDF)](https://portal.ct.gov/-/media/SDE/Turnaround/School-Improvement-Resources/Kotters_model.pdf)  
- [Kotter‚Äôs 8 Accelerators eBook (PDF)](https://www.kotterinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/8-Steps-eBook-Kotter-2018.pdf)  
- [ADKAR Model Overview (Prosci blog)](https://www.prosci.com/blog/adkar-model)  
- [ADKAR Explained (YouTube Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ok2BKSuAew)  
- [Tuckman‚Äôs Group Development Stages (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuckman%27s_stages_of_group_development)  
- [Tuckman‚Äôs Model Explained (YouTube Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RwkZxGPQb8)  

**Reflection**  
Kotter and ADKAR gave me roadmaps for leading change; Tuckman reminded me that people move at different speeds. The real skill is knowing when to adapt, when to push, and when to let the team storm a little before they settle. No single framework has the answer ‚Äî but together, they give leaders perspective.
